I have started this application as to fill in the need of having a piece of paper to doodle on while having a flash of idea and frantically searching for a piece of paper, napkin and pen to explain it to the person in front of you enjoying his food/coffee on a trouble free evening.
Also, since the various apps of this kind in the google play store ask for stupid permissions like location, call details and stuff... this seemed to me the best way to find my own way to the napkin and pen.

Following are few ideas I currently have. I have also tried to catogriese them into various version goal.
This is my first attempt at any opensource application, so please be patient with me.

Todo - Version 1:
1. White Canvas
2. Immersive Mode
3. Black Pen
4. Clear the screen for new doodling.

Various other Ideas :
1. Add eraser tool
2. Add undo tool
3. basic drawable shapes like line, rectangle, circles etc.
4. Selectable draw colour.
5. Selectable background colour.
6. Saving the current "flash of idea" as an image.
7. Extendable canvas
8. Some drawing tools like brush, airbrush etc.
